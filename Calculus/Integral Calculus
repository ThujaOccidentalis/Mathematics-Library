\subsubsection{Parts of the Integral Expression}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $ dx $ is the width of one of our infinitely narrow rectangles.
  \item $ f(x) $ is the height of each of our infinitely narrow rectangles.
  \item $ f(x)dx $ is the area of each of our infinitely narrow rectangles.
  \item $ a $ is the point at which we begin adding the areas of our infinitely narrow rectangles. This point is often referred to as the \textit{"lower limit of integration"}
  \item $ b $ is the point at which we stop adding the areas of our infinitely narrow rectangles. This point is often referred to as the \textit{"upper limit of integration"}
  \item The whole expression \LARGE \[ \int_a^b f(x)dx \]
\normalsize is the total area under the curve between $a$ and $b$
\end{enumerate}
