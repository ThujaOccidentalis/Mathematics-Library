\section{Integration Preliminaries}
\subsubsection{Parts of the Integral Expression}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $ dx $ is the width of one of our infinitely narrow rectangles.
  \item $ f(x) $ is the height of each of our infinitely narrow rectangles.
  \item $ f(x)dx $ is the area of each of our infinitely narrow rectangles.
  \item $ a $ is the point at which we begin adding the areas of our infinitely narrow rectangles. This point is often referred to as the \textit{"lower limit of integration"}
  \item $ b $ is the point at which we stop adding the areas of our infinitely narrow rectangles. This point is often referred to as the \textit{"upper limit of integration"}
  \item The whole expression \LARGE \[ \int_a^b f(x)dx \]
\normalsize is the total area under the curve between $a$ and $b$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Finding the Integral of a Function}
\subsection{The Antiderivative of a Function}
Given the expression 2x. The antiderivative of 2x is the expression that, if we take its derifative, would give us 2x. Finding the antiderivative of a function (and hence the integral of the function) is basically the reverse of finding the derivative.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The derivative of $ x^2 $ is $ 2x $
  \item The antiderivative of $ 2x $ is $ x^2 $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Unknown Constants}
Finding the derivative of two functions 
\LARGE
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \[ f(x) = x^2 + 12 \]
  \item \[ f'(x) = 2x \]
\end{enumerate}
\normalsize
and
\LARGE
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \[ f(x) = x^2 + 3 \]
  \item \[ f'(x) = 2x \]
\end{enumerate}
\normalsize
we see that both functions have the same derivative. \\ \\ In other words, we can add any number to $ x^2 $ and it does not affect the derivative.  Consequently, there are an infinite number of functions that have a derivative of $ 2x $. 
\\ \\
 To allow for this possibility, we add the letter $ C $to represent the unknown constant.
Thus the correct antiderivative for 2x is actually

\LARGE \[ x^2 + C \]

\subsubsection{Example}
\normalsize
Find the antiderivative of:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \LARGE \[ 3x + 4 \] \normalsize
  \item \textit{\textbf{Solution}} First find the antiderivative of 3x  \LARGE \[ \frac{3}{2}x^2 \] \normalsize
  \textit{\textbf{Note:}} We can check our work by finding the derivative of our expression. If our expression yields 3x, we have found the correct derivative.
  \item Next, we must address the 4 term
  \LARGE \[ \frac{3}{2}x^2 + 4x \] \normalsize
  \item The last step is to attach the letter C, (unknown constant) that might be present. Thus, the antiderivative of 3x + 4 is:
  \LARGE \[ \frac{3}{2}x^2 + 4x + C \] \normalsize
\end{enumerate}







\section{Algorithm for Finding the Antiderivatives of Simple Polynomials}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Take the exponent on the term and add 1 to it.
  \item Take this new exponent, invert it, and make this a coefficient in front of the antiderivative
    \LARGE \[ ax^n \] \normalsize
    
    \LARGE \[ \Bigg(\frac{1}{n+1} \Bigg) ax^{n+1} \] \normalsize
\end{enumerate}







\subsubsection{Example}
Find the antiderivative of
\LARGE \[ \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} \] \normalsize
\paragraph{Solution} 
Since the numerator is the derivative of the denominator, we can use the rule for natural logarithm.

\LARGE \[ ln(x^2 + 1) + C \] \normalsize

\LARGE \normalsize





\section{Using the Antiderivative to Calculate the Integral of a Function}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The first step in solving the integral is to find the antiderivative of the function $ x^2 $
\LARGE  \[ x^2 \] \normalsize
  \item \LARGE \[ \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C \] \normalsize
  \item Now we must take the end points into account
\LARGE  \[ \int\limits_{1}^{2} x^2 dx = \Bigg[ \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C  \Bigg]_1^2 \]

\normalsize
Now we will substitute the endpoints that are attached to the integral for every x, using the following three-step process:
\subsubsection{\textit{\textbf{Substituting the Endpoints into the Antiderivative}}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Substitute the top endpoint into the antiderivative everywhere there is an x. The top endpoint is \textit{always} substituted first, regardless of whether it is a positive number, negative number, or a letter.
  \item Substitute the bottom endpoint into the antiderivative everywhere there is an x. The bottom endpoint is \textit{always} substituted first, regardless of whether it is a positive number, negative number, or a letter.
  \item Subtract the antiderivative with the bottom endpoint substituted from the antiderivative with the top endpoint substituted.
\end{enumerate}

Subtracting our top and bottom points:
\normalsize
\item \LARGE \[ \int\limits_{1}^{2} x^2 dx = \Bigg[ \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C  \Bigg]_1^2 = \Bigg[ \frac{1}{3}(2)^3 + C  \Bigg]_1^2 - \Bigg[ \frac{1}{3}(1)^3 + C  \Bigg]_1^2 \]
\normalsize 

\normalsize
\item \LARGE \[ \int\limits_{1}^{2} x^2 dx = \Bigg[ \frac{1}{3}(8) + C  \Bigg] - \Bigg[ \frac{1}{3}(1) + C  \Bigg] \]
\normalsize 


\normalsize
\item \LARGE \[ \int\limits_{1}^{2} x^2 dx = \Bigg[ \frac{8}{3} + C  \Bigg] - \Bigg[ \frac{1}{3} + C  \Bigg] \]
\normalsize 


\normalsize
\item \LARGE \[ \int\limits_{1}^{2} x^2 dx =  \frac{8}{3} + C -  \frac{1}{3} - C  \]
\normalsize 


\normalsize
\item \LARGE \[ \int\limits_{1}^{2} x^2 dx =  \frac{7}{3}  \]
\normalsize 

The area under the function $ f(x) = x^2 $ between $ x = 1 $ and $ x = 2 $ is $ \frac{7}{3} $

\end{enumerate}
