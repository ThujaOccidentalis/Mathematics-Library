\section{Integration Preliminaries}
\subsubsection{Parts of the Integral Expression}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $ dx $ is the width of one of our infinitely narrow rectangles.
  \item $ f(x) $ is the height of each of our infinitely narrow rectangles.
  \item $ f(x)dx $ is the area of each of our infinitely narrow rectangles.
  \item $ a $ is the point at which we begin adding the areas of our infinitely narrow rectangles. This point is often referred to as the \textit{"lower limit of integration"}
  \item $ b $ is the point at which we stop adding the areas of our infinitely narrow rectangles. This point is often referred to as the \textit{"upper limit of integration"}
  \item The whole expression \LARGE \[ \int_a^b f(x)dx \]
\normalsize is the total area under the curve between $a$ and $b$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Finding the Integral of a Function}
\subsection{The Antiderivative of a Function}
Given the expression 2x. The antiderivative of 2x is the expression that, if we take its derifative, would give us 2x. Finding the antiderivative of a function (and hence the integral of the function) is basically the reverse of finding the derivative.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The derivative of $ x^2 $ is $ 2x $
  \item The antiderivative of $ 2x $ is $ x^2 $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Unknown Constants}
Finding the derivative of two functions 
\LARGE
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \[ f(x) = x^2 + 12 \]
  \item \[ f'(x) = 2x \]
\end{enumerate}
\normalsize
and
\LARGE
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \[ f(x) = x^2 + 3 \]
  \item \[ f'(x) = 2x \]
\end{enumerate}
\normalsize
we see that both functions have the same derivative. \\ \\ In other words, we can add any number to $ x^2 $ and it does not affect the derivative.  Consequently, there are an infinite number of functions that have a derivative of $ 2x $. 
\\ \\
 To allow for this possibility, we add the letter $ C $to represent the unknown constant.
Thus the correct antiderivative for 2x is actually

\LARGE \[ x^2 + C \]

\subsubsection{Example}
\normalsize
Find the antiderivative of:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \LARGE \[ 3x + 4 \] \normalsize
  \item \textit{\textbf{Solution}} First find the antiderivative of 3x  \LARGE \[ \frac{3}{2}x^2 \] \normalsize
  \textit{\textbf{Note:}} We can check our work by finding the derivative of our expression. If our expression yields 3x, we have found the correct derivative.
  \item Next, we must address the 4 term
\end{enumerate}
